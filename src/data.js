export const FAQ = [
  { q: "How does coverage actually work?", a: "After a short intake and review of your operations, we build a written playbook and assign an operator matched to your venue. They run the day-to-day during your agreed dates and send you an end-of-day report." },
  { q: "How do you vet your operators?", a: "Every operator is background-checked and has hands-on experience running entertainment or hospitality venues. We match operators to your specific format before any coverage begins." },
  { q: "How long can you cover my business?", a: "Anywhere from a few days to extended periods. Most owners start with a short pilot window to build confidence before scheduling longer coverage." },
  { q: "What does it cost?", a: "Pricing depends on your business type, the length of coverage, and operational complexity. Apply for a pilot and we'll give you a clear, no-surprise quote." },
  { q: "What if there's an emergency?", a: "Every engagement includes an emergency escalation plan agreed with you in advance, so your operator knows exactly who to call and when." },
  { q: "Do you sign an NDA?", a: "Yes. Confidentiality and a signed NDA are standard, and operators are given only the limited system access they need to do the job." },
  { q: "Which industries do you serve?", a: "Escape rooms, axe-throwing venues, trampoline parks, family entertainment centers, and indoor activity venues today — with hotels and motels coming soon." },
  { q: "How do I get started?", a: "Head to the Contact page and apply for pilot coverage. We respond within one business day to talk through your needs." },
